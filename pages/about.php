      <p class="lead">Have any useless items at home, just sitting in the storage?</p>
      <p class="mb-1">Something that is useless to you might be useful for some people. Why not make some money out of it instead?</p>
      <p>Instead of displaying items at your front yard, hoping for people stop by, simply post your items online, sit back and relax.</p>
      <p class="lead">Looking for specific items for cheaper price?</p>
      <p class="mb-1">Because the items are mostly used and sold because the sellers no longer need them, most of the items you find here are much cheaper.</p>
      <p>Besides, you may be able to negotiate for even better price!</p>
      <p class="mb-0 lead">Feel free to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Post any (legal & appropriate) items for sale.</li>
        <li>Look for specific items from local area.</li>
        <li>Get connected with local neighbors!</li>
